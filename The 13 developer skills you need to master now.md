### 1 Brush up on JavaScript
 
These days, developers who have mastered JavaScript can’t go wrong, say those we surveyed. JavaScript proficiency is by far the most frequently sought skill named by executives and recruiters. 

### 2 Go big with data

“While big data has been around for years, it’s a trend that’s here to stay,” says Andrey Akselrod, co-founder and CTO of Smartling. “Developers must have in-depth knowledge of [business intelligence] and analytics products, machine learning tools, and other solutions that transfer, store, and aggregate large amounts of data. Only then can they help their organizations store, interact, and analyze big data to make better business decisions.” 

### 3 Master the full stack

Bryan Reinero, developer advocate at MongoDB, says going forward, engineers will need a broader range of skills to be effective: “Fortunately, increasing the scope of expertise is both healthy for the engineer as well as for the company in which she works.” 

### 4 Buy into devops

The skills companies are looking for today are considerably more varied compared to a few years ago, says WinterWyman Search’s Stagno: “Java and C# remain a part of the market, but when you look at companies founded after the last recession, you're seeing a variety: Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, Node.js, and the emergence of functional programming languages, with Scala the most prevalent. 

### 6 Use the source

In particular for freelancers, the ability to point to your code on GitHub shows that your work has been put to good use and reviewed by your peers.

“Work on meaningful libraries and open-source them to demonstrate instantaneous value to potential employers,” says Kiran Bondalapati, co-founder and CTO of ZeroStack,

### 7 Be agile -- and hone your teamwork skills

Agile development should be part of a coders’ quiver of skills in 2016, says Greg Sterndale, co-founder of PromptWorks, a Philadelphia software consulting shop specializing in Web and mobile applications. And keep it simple: “Be humble and be hungry. Be familiar with agile and lean methodologies -- the ability to break down big projects into small stories, prioritizing, adapting to change, and delivering the most value.” 

### 8 Get secure
“They’re taking more proactive approaches to increase security, not only within their IT department but across the board,” Murphy says. “We’ll see a shift in the most in-demand technologies this year as a result.

Experts noted the increased demand for network security, in particular adaptive application security, as well as cloud security

### 9 Go mobile

“When mobile first emerged, the first-order problem was the app: How do I build these remarkable experiences that will run well across device types and operating systems?” says Jeff Haynie, CEO and co-founder of mobile technology company Appcelerator. “As the industry matured in this, acquiring better skills and tools, everyone now confronts the next big challenge: How do I get data -- in the right format, of the right size, with the right resiliency and responsiveness -- fed into these apps? That’s a much bigger trick.” 

### 10 To the cloud

Unsurprisingly there’s a steady demand for developers familiar with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. “In cloud providers, Amazon is still the biggest player by far, so keep up to date with their more advanced offerings like the API Gateway, Lambda, and the Container Service,” says Nic Benders, chief architect at New Relic.

But it’s not all about tools, when it comes to developing career opportunities in the cloud. In part of an ongoing trend, companies are looking for developers with business skills, including project management and the ability to negotiate with vendors, says TEKsystems’ Hayman. “Additionally, there’s a need for more ‘move the business forward’-type skills, but less of a need for tactical work, as cloud providers are now increasingly responsible for that,” he says. 

### 11 IoT: Making connections

“You can do it even as a JavaScript developer,” says Flybits’ Hossein Rahnama. “The advent of protocols such as Wi-Fi Halo and wearable and IoT devices opening lightweight SDKs, will open many opportunities for developers to go beyond displays and build things for their surroundings and environments. We will also see many hardware/software co-designs due to the advent of these tools.” 

### 12 Be persuasive

“Client management skills are important, particularly the ability to push back tactfully but convincingly when there are alternatives that deliver more value,” says PromptWorks’ Sterndale. “Also being able to educate clients about the nature of software, guiding them toward practices that will serve them best in the long run.”

“It’s more important than ever … to demonstrate strong communication skills in a business setting,” says Addison Group’s Murphy. “With data security and privacy becoming exceedingly important in the boardroom, IT pros must concisely present their work in an easy-to-understand manner.” 

### 13 Be flexible

If you’re the 10x, full-stack developer on your team, there’s more demand than supply for your services. But if you’re starting out or making a career change, the right attitude can make all the difference in getting -- and staying -- hired. 
	
“Being a good team member, having a willingness to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem, lending a helping hand to team members, volunteering ideas and efforts to improve the product or the culture are valuable to any team.”
